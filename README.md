## University homeworks

The univeristy homeworks from two CS courses taken: CSCI 151 - Programming for Scientists and engineers, CSCI 232 - Operating Systems

### Getting Started

Just directly download the files or fork the repo to get started.
For clarity:
- AishabibiAdambek_2.c - simple assignment to count the level of person's so-called goodness based on his good deeds;
- png_corrupted_restore.c - [from OS] assignment to uncorrupt PNG files with simple corruption pattern: every IDAT bit XORed with 256;
- simple_shell.c - [from OS] assignment to write simple shell in C that can perform operations in background (though 'zombies' are not handled), implement pipes and common redirect operations (<, >, >>);
- aadambek_final_server.c - [from OS] final project in Operating Systems class: a quiz server that uses multi-threading and synchronization to run quizzes and non-blocking events to welcome new users and to distribute quizzes to users. The quiz server still has some mistakes in synchronization (mostly with running several quizzes simultaneously).

### Prerequisites

You do not need any additional software to run C code on your machine.

### Approach

The code uploaded for those who seek some examples of how to write code in C.
If you are using it for your own homework, please make sure you do not end up plagiarizing. Beware of the consequences.
